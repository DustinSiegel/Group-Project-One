This Application is an emotional assistant for dealing with the stages of grief associated with a relationship breaking up. It uses persistent databasing through Firebase so that when a user signs up or signs in, the application will point them towords the relevant data based on their specific stage of grief based on the amount of time that has passed since the date of the breakup. That is handled by moment.js compared to the user input. 

The application assists with grief by suggesting distractions in the form of books, movies and music that have themes that are relevant to coping with the specific grief catagory. This information is pulled from available Apis using Ajax calls to get json packets. It utilizes html with bootstrap for mobile responsiveness, css for stylization, javascript, jQuery, moment.js and Ajax for functionality and Firebase for persistent databasing.
